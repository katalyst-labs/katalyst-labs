## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>By day I'm a professional web / software developer and by night I'm an electronics enthusiast with a passion for tinkering. My muses come in the form of cats, coffee, and women, inspiring me to create new things. However, when I'm not coding away on the computer you can find me devouring non-fiction books or watching an old school clean romance movie.</p>

<p>I am highly experienced in web scraping, working with both static HTML and dynamic sites with real-time data, which is my main focus within software automation. My tech stack primarily consists of Flask and SQLite / PostgreSQL, though I also use Node.js acoupled with Express.js when needed.</p>

<p>You can find some of my projects on my repository page, and there are even more helpful shell scripts in my <a>Gists section.</a src="https://gist.github.com/katalyst-labs"> These scripts, which I use daily to streamline tasks, are there for you to adapt to your own use case if you find them helpful.</p>
