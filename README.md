## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>I am a self-taught software developer specialising in automation and web technologies. I draw inspiration from cats, coffee, and the art of creating elegant solutions to complex problems.</p>

<p>My primary expertise lies in web scraping and data extraction, working extensively with both static HTML and dynamic sites featuring real-time data.</p>

<p>My journey in technology began as a PC hardware and networking technician, where I gained valuable experience assembling computers and configuring networking devices. Beyond pure software development, I have ventured into IoT projects, successfully implementing solutions such as automated garden irrigation systems. This practical experience in hardware integration complements my software expertise, allowing me to approach problems with a full-stack perspective.</p>


<p>My daily workflow is streamlined through various shell scripts, which you can find in my Gists section. Feel free to adapt these tools for your own use cases.</p>


<p>When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me expanding my knowledge through non-fiction reading, experimenting in the kitchen with cooking and baking, or unwinding with a good'ol clean romance movie.</p>

<p>Let's connect and build something remarkable together.</p>
