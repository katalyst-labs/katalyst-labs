## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>I'm a self-taught software developer specializing in automationâ€”web scraping, crawling, and compiling data are my bread and butter. By night, I dive into my passions: tinkering with electronics, experimenting in the kitchen, or unwinding with a good movie. My muses? Cats, coffee, and the company of inspiring womenâ€”they fuel my creativity and keep me grounded.</p>


<p>Before venturing into software, I worked as a PC hardware and network technician, assembling PCs and setting up networking devices, backed by vocational training. This hands-on experience laid the foundation for my technical problem-solving skills. I've also explored the world of IoT, building small projects like an automated garden watering system.</p>


<p>My primary tech stack revolves around Flask, SQLite, and PostgreSQL. When the situation calls for it, I turn to Node.js with Express.js. Iâ€™m also proficient in full-stack web development, combining my backend expertise with front-end skills for seamless web solutions.</p>


<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction, cooking, and baking, or catching an old-school clean romance movie. On my GitHub, you'll find projects that showcase my work in automation and more. Donâ€™t forget to check out my Gists section, where I share handy shell scripts to streamline everyday tasksâ€”feel free to adapt them to your needs.</p>
